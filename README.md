# BlanketOracle-Version-1.0
This is a Blanket recommender which recommends a blanket based of the outdoor temperature. As it predicts the indoor temperature based off the outdoor temperature. I used Linear Regression to train the model, where the target variable is the outdoor temperature[tempmax] and the feature is the indoor temperature[temp]. I used CSV file for my data.
